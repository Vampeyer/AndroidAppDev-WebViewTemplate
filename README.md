# AndroidAppDev-WebViewTemplate
This is a template for making applications in android , from websites. 



The local html , css , and js files can be placed in the assets folder , and 
then the loadurl() method , can point to that path , 
to web view any locally built files.  

To use an online url , use the file/// annotation provided in the code in the 
MainAcrivity.java 
file , change the path , and build the code. 

- Its all ready and good to go , navigation is working , Iframes are working. 

The only thing I was having issues with was with browser compatability issues but , 

-- This code is good to use for reference for WebViews in Android Applications. 

------ Java Build ------------------
